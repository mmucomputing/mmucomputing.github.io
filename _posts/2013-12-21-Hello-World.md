Hello all,

Firstly, welcome! This is our new website, which has (honestly) been a long time coming. Over the coming weeks we'll be populating it with resources from the talks and presentations we've already given and then we'll keep updating it as and when we do new talks. Furthermore, we also intend to publish some articles by students; we're excited to see what you guys are interested in writing about and hope to get some good content on here soon.

I'm also excited to tell you we can finally accept student membership! Unfortunately, because we started after September in the academic year we struggled to get membership options. However, we can now accept membership for the low, low price of **£1!** We've opted to accept paid membership in order to maintain a decent quality of membership and we intend to provide benefits to those students who become paid members. If you're interested in goodies and helping us put on better events, please go [here](http://www.mmunion.co.uk/studentactivities/manchester/societies/computing/) and sign up!

Finally, it's time to give you guys an idea of what we'll be up to in the New Year. We'll be continuing our series of student talks from last term, this term's talks will include:

* A crash course on [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
* An introduction to [Go](http://golang.org/).
* A talk on [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/).

... and a tonne more. In addition to these we will be running a lightning talk session, where students (and guests!) who don't want to talk for an entire 30 minute session can talk about something which interests them for a few minutes with some Q&A. This is a fabulous opportunity for students to develop their speaking skills and share their passion with others, as well as learn something new. We also intend on running the assignment drop-in sessions, although these may be changed to exam preparation sessions. As always, if there's something you're interested in hearing about, please feel free to post on the Facebook group or get in touch with any of the committee.

I look forward to seeing you all again after the holidays!
